# Introduction
With this repository I want to show what is possible in Minecraft Bedrock and that the limits are much lower than many think.<br/>
Sometimes it is just tricky!<br/>
## What you'll find here
I want to upload information about the offical <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bedrock_Dedicated_Server">bedrock dedicated server</a> and what is posible using this tool.<br/>
I also want to share my learnings about addons for Bedrock.<br/>
Have fun!
# Bedrock Dedicated Server
You can <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/">download</a> the offical server for the bedrock edition <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock/">here</a>! Remember that the bedrock dedicated server is still in alpha so be carefull and make backups as often as you can!<br/>
You'll find a really good article about how to setup the server with scripting and addons <a href="https://github.com/perrochon/simple-bedrock-script/blob/master/README.md">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To get startet with server scripting you should have a look at <a href="Server/Scripting/FirstScript.js">Server/Scripting/FirstScript.js</a>!

# Addons
You can just go to the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Add-on">offical wiki page</a> about addons. I'll tell you what I have learned soon.<br/>
Templates and 2 examples can be found <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Add-on#Templates">here</a>.
